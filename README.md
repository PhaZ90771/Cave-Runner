# Cave-Runner
This was my first entry. It was rather challenging getting a game up and running from scratch in 72 hours, especially since I only ended up being able to work part of the weekend.

I coded this in C++ using Visual Studio Express 2012. I used the SDL and OpenGL libraries for the graphics. All graphics are generated in code. The cave is randomly generated as you go.

To play just extract the zip and run the "LD48-26.exe" file. Controls are listed below.

Move: Arrow Keys

Hope you have fun!
